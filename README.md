# Causal machine learning framework for pharmacovigilance signal detection in electronic health records: Drug-induced acute kidney injury

In this work, we implemented a CML framework using the MIMIC-IV database to detect acute drug-induced kidney injury, demonstrating that CML can provide interpretable, personalized, and clinically relevant information. The results position causal AI as a promising avenue for improving the accuracy, transparency, and regulatory acceptance of pharmacovigilance systems.
